Molecular forces determine the physico-chemical properties of various forms of matter such as gases, liquids and solids. The major focus of this virtual lab is to 
provide a thorough grounding in the fundamental concepts of molecular forces (without using quantum mechanical principles) to undergraduate students and 
introduce them to the optical and magnetic tweezer experimental techniques that are used to measure molecular forces. 
</p>
 <p align="justify">
The most stable geometry of a molecule is determined by the balance of attractive and repulsive forces between its atoms. 
The interactions between the atoms of a molecule can be split into two groups, bonded and non-bonded interactions. 
In the former group all intramolecular interactions such as bonds, angles and dihedrals are being taken care of, 
whereas in the latter interactions such as Van der Waals and electrostatics are considered. 
</p>
 <p align="justify">
The aim of this lab is to use optical and magnetic tweezer experiments to understand the nature of molecular forces and associated parameters
that quantify the strengths of these atomic interactions.

	    All physical, chemical, and  biological phenomena happening around and within us originate from intermolecular interactions. These interactions (or forces) determine the structure, dynamics, and thermodynamical properties of gases, liquids and solids. Thus, in order to  gain insights into various macroscopic phenomena and properties of macroscopic matter it is essential to understand the nature of interactions and the kinds of forces acting within and between  molecules that constitute the matter.

	<p align="justify"><b> Optical tweezers  :</b> In optical tweezers highly focused laser beam is used to exert forces  on nanometer and micrometer sized dielectric particles.The laser beam consisting of both electric and magnetic field is focused by passing it through microscope objective. The narrowest point of the focused beam known as beam waist contains a very strong electric field gradient so that the  dielectric particles are attracted along the region of strongest electric field which is the center of the beam. 
       Light consists of photons that each have momentum. A ray of light impinging on the interface of dielectric particle  has its direction of propagation, and therefore its momentum, changed by the interaction of the light with the particle. Since the particle  changes the momentum of the light, an equal and opposite change in momentum of the particle occurs. The resultant force of the light on the particle due to refraction is always in the direction of the focus of the light . Thus, in the absence of other forces, the particle is attracted to the focal point of the light.This force is known as scattering force.
